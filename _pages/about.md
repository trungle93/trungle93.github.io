I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the [NeuroAI](https://github.com/shlizee) lab at the University of Washington, where I am advised by [Prof. Eli Shlizerman](http://faculty.washington.edu/shlizee/index.html). My research interests lie in the intersection of Deep Learning, Computational Neuroscience and Signal Processing.
