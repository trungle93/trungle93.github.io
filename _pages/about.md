I am a PhD student in the [NeuroAI Lab](https://github.com/shlizee) at the University of Washington, where I am advised by [Prof. Eli Shlizerman](http://faculty.washington.edu/shlizee/index.html). My research interests lie in the intersection of Deep Learning, Computational Neuroscience and Signal Processing. I am particularly interested in developing high-performing and interpretable models to advance understanding of the nervous system from large-scale recordings. 

Prior to joining University of Washington, I completed my MS degree in ECE at University of California, Los Angeles, and BS degree in EE at Texas A&M University, where I worked with Prof. Fabien Scalzo, Prof. Steven Chase, Prof. Roozbeh Jafari, and Prof. Peng Li.
